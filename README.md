**Research Goal:** My research goal is to predict the hourly demand for taxi rides in New York City.

**Timeline:** The timeline for the research area is 2021-10 to 2022-04

Before running any files, ensure that you have:
1. Downloaded the Zone files (https://d37ci6vzurychx.cloudfront.net/misc/taxi_zones.zip) and placed the `taxi_zone' folder under the data/raw/ directory.

Then:
2. Run all cells in `Weather datascrape.ipynb' to retrieve hourly weather data.
3. Run all cells in `EDA.ipynb' to retrieve preprocessed data and output them in data/curated for modelling. (This may take a while)
4. Run `model.ipynb' to train and test the regression models on the preprocessed data.
